1. App crashes when adding item with empty fields.
2. Need to add ScrollView to improve functioning layouts in horizontal mode.
3. Logic for updating account balances. If stmt in Position.java to control the flow.
4. Basically, income and expense methods are done. Need to work on internal wire and setting balances.
5. Despite the incrementation of _id in Item's constructor, it does not work.
6. Create a class that extends SqLiteOpenHelper and code the logic for db interaction.
7. Loading the db should be done via service in the background, so that the user do not need to wait
for the app.
8. Accounts' balances need to be saved to file and loaded when the app starts. Might be a service.
